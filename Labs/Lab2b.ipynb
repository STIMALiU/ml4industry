    "In the previous problem we looked at predicting if an item was **sold** on eBay. The dataset actually contained more information. The column <tt>nBids</tt> records the **exact number of bids** in each auction. \n",
    "In this part of the lab you will build a model that can predict the number of bids in an auction.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not obvious how to set up a loss function and all that here. We could use squared error $(y-\\hat y)^2$, but that is less suitable when the data are not Gaussian. Rather than making up a loss function in an ad hoc fashion, we will assume a distribution for the data and then use maximum likelihood to learn the parameters. This lab will get you closer to the bare metal of fitting ML models to data.\n",

    "Here the data are discrete **counts**, i.e. non-negative integers. There are many distributions for such data, but the most famous one is the **Poisson distribution** $Y\\sim\\mathrm{Pois}(\\mu)$ with probability density (or mass function):\n",

    "Now, if $Y\\sim\\mathrm{Pois}(\\mu)$, then the mean is $\\mathbb{E}Y=\\mu$. We want to model the mean of this distribution as a regression, that is as a function of features, just like we did in the classification problem. However, setting $\\mathbb{E}Y=\\mu=\\mathbf{x}^\\top \\mathbf{w}$ is not great since $\\mu$ must be strictly positive and we would have to put awkward restrictions on $\\mathbf{w}$ to guarantee this. Let us instead use the model:\n",
