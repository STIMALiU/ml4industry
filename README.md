### Course information
**The typical participant** has a degree in engineering, finance or other quantitative fields. We recommend that participants have taken at least one course in each of the following subjects:

* linear algebra
* calculus
* statistics
* programming

**Examination and Grades**: The report from each computer lab will be graded Pass or Fail. Successful completion of all five labs gives the grade Pass on the whole course.

**Course organization**
The course is organized in four topics, each containing six lecture hours and a computer lab.
